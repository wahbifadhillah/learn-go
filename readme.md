# Learn GO

Welcome to my GO Lang learning journey! I'm excited to share my progress as I delve into this powerful programming language. This repository is a living document of my growth, documenting my hands-on experiences and key takeaways.

## Course Information

I'm learning from the comprehensive course [Go - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-guide/) by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller. It's packed with practical lessons, exercises, and real-world projects to help me master GO.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into sections corresponding to the major course modules. Each section contains a dedicated README with detailed notes, code examples, and project explorations.
